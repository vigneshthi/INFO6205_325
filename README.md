Final Project - Genetic Algorithm to resolve knapsack problem

```
GOAL: 
The goal of this Project is to write a genetic algorithm that solves the 01 Knapsack Problem. 
Briefly stated, the Knapsack Problem is: You have a collection of N objects of different weights, w1, w2, …, wn, and different values, v1, v2, …, vn, and a knapsack that can only hold a certain maximum combined weight W. You would like to get a set of objects of maximal value into the knapsack.
```

### Prerequisites

Install a IDE(I used iDEA itellij)

```
iDEA itellij
```

### Installing

Clone or Download the project and open it from the IDE.


## Running the tests

The unit test are configured with Junit.
You can run the test with mvn test command in terminal or run the GeneticAlgorithmTest.java fill with Junit
